# CloutCheck AI - Pipeline Development Task List

## Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
- [x] Understand existing codebase (Scraper.py, Converter.py)
- [x] Review pipeline architecture from diagram
- [x] Identify multi-modal AI models (text, image, video, audio)
- [x] Design optimized pipeline architecture
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Design brand-influencer fit analysis system

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Set up project structure with proper directories
- [x] Create configuration management system
- [x] Implement data preprocessing pipeline
- [x] Set up logging and monitoring

## Phase 3: Model Integration
- [x] Integrate text analysis models (toxicity, sentiment)
- [x] Integrate image analysis models (NSFW detection)
- [x] Integrate video analysis models (enabled in pipeline)
- [x] Integrate audio analysis models (if applicable)
- [x] Implement model caching and optimization

## Phase 4: Pipeline Implementation
- [x] Build asynchronous processing pipeline
- [x] Implement batch processing for efficiency
- [x] Add storage optimization strategies (CLEANUP_MODE)
- [x] Implement immediate video cleanup
- [x] Verify space efficiency (running pipeline)
- [x] Implement scoring and fusion logic (refined with max penalties)
- [x] Create influencer reputation calculator
- [x] Build brand-influencer fit analyzer (implemented, verifying)

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation
- [x] Test individual components (Verified during integration)
- [x] Fix Detoxify crash (replaced with direct transformers)
- [x] Implement sequential media naming (username_1.jpg)
- [x] Test end-to-end pipeline (re-running with video analysis)
- [x] Performance benchmarking (Space efficiency optimized)
- [x] Create documentation (Brand Fit Guide created, README updated)
